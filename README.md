## Hi there 👋

Nice to see you here!  
I’m Chetreli, a Junior Data Scientist based in Russia 🇷🇺

I’m building a strong foundation in data science 🚀  
I follow a structured learning roadmap and grow through practice.

I work with the Python data science stack 🐍  
NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.  
I use SQL for data analysis and understand database design 🗄️  
I’m also familiar with basic CI/CD concepts ⚙️

Here you’ll find my pet projects 💡  
They span healthcare, business, and banking domains.  
The work covers both machine learning and data analytics 📊  
I enjoy turning data into insights and learning by doing.
